## Plot (WIP)
At the start of the game, Nameless, our ordinary sushi chef, sets out to take down a cult that killed his master years ago. At the end of the battle he found out that this is only a sub branch of the real cult. His search leads him to Edom City where he declares war on all these evil cults.

Kimberly and Jigen are well known hitmen, are hired by the cult to kill Nameless but they chose to befriend him instead. Nameless got invited to the Zenith Hotel and he learned the rules of the underworld. As they dig deeper, they discover that the cult controls everything in the city. The Lawmaker, the secret leader of Zenith Hotel, he pretends to work for the cult but secretly helps the protagonists.

As the group continues to take down the cult's various groups, they eventually come face-to-face with the Cult Leader, the mastermind behind everything. With his charismatic leadership, the Cult Leader has managed to gain the support of the city's elite, making him a formidable, untouchable opponent.

Nameless and his allies must use all of their skills and resources to defeat the Cult Leader and his top subordinates, all while uncovering the truth about the cult's sinister plans for the city. As they fight their way through the Cult's hideouts, the group discovers that Nameless has a dark secret: he has been unknowingly hosting an eldritch god inside his mind, giving him immense power but also putting him at risk of losing control. The cult is aware that "entity" is a mythical god-eating monster and want to capture Nameless to kill it.

In the end, the fate of the city rests on the shoulders of Nameless and his allies as they face off against the Cult Leader and his minions in a final, epic battle. With their determination, wits and skills, they must stop the Cult's plan before it's too late and bring justice for those who have suffered.

### Shadow Dancer Clan (neutral)
An all female assassin clan. They're impressed after seeing Nameless fights and want him to join the clan. (Nameless's gender is kinda ambiguous due to not being 100% human)

### The Cult (Main Antagonists)

Your main enemies in the game are cult members, cult leaders and the monsters they summon.

The cults are hidden in the city, they lure innocent people in and do horrible things (both violent and non-violent crime).
There were 12 cults in total (1 main, 11 branches). One of them got wiped out by Nameless in the beginning.
- The Cult Leaders: charismatic and powerful, each of them are immortal (until Nameless shows). They have crazy reality-bending powers. No one in the city knows who/where they are and what they look like so it forces the players to find clues to track them down.
	+ Leader No.12
	+ Leader No.11 WIP
	+ Leader No.10 WIP
	+ Leader No.9 WIP
	+ Leader No.8 WIP
	+ Leader No.7 WIP
	+ Leader No.6 WIP
	+ Leader No.5 WIP
	+ Leader No.4 WIP
	+ Leader No.3 WIP
	+ Leader No.2 WIP
	+ Leader No.1: WIP
  
- Corrupt Government Officials and Corporate: controlled by the cult, mostly do white collar crime
- Corrupt Cops: follow orders from the Government Officials, they take advantage of small businesses in the city to extort money.
- The Cult Members: weak minded people who got lured and controlled by the leaders to do unspeakable crimes (similar to Aum Shinrikyo)

## Power System

- Forbidden Magic: people with natural magic are already extinct. So most magic in the game world comes from people making contract with interdimensional entities. You usually have to offer something to get a contract.
- `CURSED TATTOO`: some characters have these tattoos that modify their stats (ex: Ava has the Equalizer tattoo that matches her stat with the strongest person in her POV)
- `AURA`: strong characters can emit a circular aura around them. Different people have different rules inside their aura. If enemies step inside that aura range then they have to obey a certain `RULE`. (ex: Nameless aura makes people unable to use magic)

## Equipments (mostly weapons since armors are just fashion)

- Normal weapon: guns, blades from the modern world
- Set weapon: the most powerful weapons in the game comes from one of the many sets. Each set is crafted made by one family.
	+ Demon Slayer Set: gives user new unique skills.
	+ Paladin Set: bless its owner with big stats and shield.
	+ ... :usually weak but apply crazy debuff that stacks.
	+ ...
	+ ...
- Cursed Weapon: hard to use but powerful, has some small stat debuff which force players to build their character to compensate, there is a gruesome, disturbing origin behind these weapons.

## Character Stats

- `HP` bar: health
- `DODGE` bar (to replace SHIELD): character will automatically dodge when this bar isn't 0.
- `STRESS` bar: cult members can cast psychological attacks on player that cause debuff (slow, stun, inaccuracy, damage reduction) when it reach below 0.

## Basic Gameplay

- Players will travel through a big tall building (for example like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology), clearing all enemies to get to the next floor. After clearing a floor they will receive a buff (charm) to get stronger.
- Some enemies are tanky and may require long combos. You can to a `FINISHER`
- Roguelike: players receive temporary charms after they clear a stage/floor. These `CHARM` will disappear after the stage is over but they're very powerful and will help players survive the brutal difficulty.
- Loot: enemies will drop weapons that you can pickup and enhance/modify with runes
- Progression: If player dies, they only lose their "charms" (temporary boost items), they always keep their weapons, skills, levels,...

## Controls

Cult Hunter is designed for PC. I want a simplified, more accessible combat system. No more training to get a long combo.

- Move: `W,A,S,D`
- Jump: `SPACE`
- Dash: tap `SHIFT`, dash into an obstacle will make characters "parkour" through it
- Dash Attack: `SHIFT`-> `LEFT MOUSE`
- Dash Jump: `SHIFT` -> `SPACE`
- Crouch: `CTRL`
- Running: hold `SHIFT` to run, you can do `WALL RUNNING` if you run and touch a wall.
- View: `MOVE MOUSE`
- Block: `RIGHT MOUSE`
- Attack : `LEFT MOUSE`
- Launcher: `SCROLL WHEEL UP`, launch enemies into the air
- Pick/throw/kick: `G`, if your character can't pick something up, like a heavy table, they'll launch it into nearest enemies. If there's nothing to pickup, they'll kick enemies.
- Skills: `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`
- Rage: `Q`+`E`
  
- `ENDER`: ender is a unique mechanic in Cult Hunter, after the end of a long combo, you can press `Q` or `E` to launch a devasting explosive attack. Some characters have AoE `ENDER`, some have single target `ENDER`, some even have unique `ENDER` mechanics (stacks, debuffs)

Most combos are just:
- `LEFT MOUSE` x2, x3, x4, x5 then end with `Q` or `E`
 
`RANGE` matters:
- Characters do different attacks depend on the range and the angle between them and the enemies.
- `REACHING`: If your enemies are far away, your characters will automatically do long range attack to try to reach them
- `AIMING`: you do different attacks based on the body part you aim. If you aim at someone's legs, your characters will try to chop their legs.

`STEALTH` matters:
- You're always outnumbered by the cult, try to sneak through, disable alarms early.

`CHARISMA` matters:
- You can clear missions by picking the right dialogue instead of fighting.
