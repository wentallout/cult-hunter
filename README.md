# cult-hunter
Khoa's work-in-progress game.

## Plot (WIP)

The city is in chaos as seven sub-cults and their main cult wreak havoc on its streets. Innocent people are being lured in and controlled to do unspeakable crimes, and it seems like there's no end to the madness. In the midst of it all, our heroes team up to take down the cults and bring peace back to the city.

As they delve deeper into the cults' operations, they uncover a shocking truth - a real eldritch god is living inside the mind of our nameless chef, giving him the power to cancel all magic attacks. The cults are aware of this too and will stop at nothing to capture him and harness his power for their own sinister purposes.

The trio faces a constant battle against the cults and their minions, fighting for their lives and the future of the city. Along the way, they make allies with members of the Racing Club and even some members of the Assassin Club.

But as they get closer to their goal, they face the ultimate challenge - The Lawmaker, the leader of the Assassin Club and the strongest assassin of them all. He has been manipulating the cults from behind the scenes, using them for his own gain. The team must defeat him and take down the main cult before they can finally bring peace to the city.

Throughout their journey, the trio faces unexpected twists and turns, with each victory only leading to more challenges and greater dangers. Will they be able to overcome the odds and save the city, or will they fall victim to the cults' evil schemes? Only time will tell in this non-stop intense and unpredictable game.
