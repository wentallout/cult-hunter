|---------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| New Edom City 	| The city which is the main location of the game. It's a very chaotic place, people live in fear, some are being scammed by sinister corporate individuals, some are lured into these "clubs" that turns out to be doomsday cults. 	|
| Talon Street  	| It's a hidden part of the city protected by top-tier charms. It's known for its high-end weapon stores and The Hotel                                                                                                                    	|
| The Hotel     	| I'm still working on the name. Basically a safe haven for all Hitmen.                                                                                                                                                                                                    	|

## Plot (WIP)
At the start of the game, Nameless, our chef (who turns out to be a martial art expert), sets out to take down a cult that killed his master years ago. At the end of the battle he found out that this is only a sub branch of the cult. His search leads him to New Edom City where he declares war on all the cults.

Kimberly and Jigen, staying in the Assassin Club, are hired by the cult to kill Nameless but, upon realizing the truth, they join him on his mission. As they dig deeper, they discover that the cult controls everything in the city. The Lawmaker is initially believed to be working for the cult but is later revealed to be a good guy, he pretends to work for the cult but secretly helps the protagonists.

As the group continues to take down the cult's various sub-groups, they eventually come face-to-face with the Cult Leader, the mastermind behind everything. With his charismatic leadership, the Cult Leader has managed to gain the support of the city's elite, making him a formidable opponent.

Nameless and his allies must use all of their skills and resources to defeat the Cult Leader and his top subordinates, all while uncovering the truth about the cult's sinister plans for the city. As they fight their way through the Cult's hideouts, the group discovers that Nameless has a dark secret: he has been unknowingly hosting an eldritch god inside his mind, giving him immense power but also putting him at risk of losing control.

In the end, the fate of the city rests on the shoulders of Nameless and his allies as they face off against the Cult Leader and his minions in a final, epic battle. With their determination and skills, they must stop the Cult's plan before it's too late and bring justice to those who have suffered under their rule.

### Hitmen (neutral)
It's simple, you give them money, they kill for you, they don't pick sides. "The Hotel" is neutral sanctuary for hitmen. Hitmen are people from all background, thousands of them live in the city, they usually hangout in the Assassin Club Hotel and enjoy all the privilege: food, safety (like in John Wick).

### Shadow Dancer Clan (neutral)
An all female assassin clan. They're impressed after seeing Nameless fights and want him to join the clan. (Nameless's gender is kinda ambiguous due to not being 100% human)

### The Cult (main antagonist)
The cults are hidden in the city, they lure innocent people in and do horrible things (both violent and non-violent crime).
There were 12 cults in total (1 main, 11 branches). One of them got wiped out by Nameless in the beginning.
- The Cult Leaders: charismatic leaders, each of them are immortal (until Nameless cancel them) and have crazy reality-bending powers. No one in the city knows who/where they are and what they look like so it forces the players to find clues to track them down.
	+ No.12
	+ No.11
	+ No.10
	+ No.9
	+ No.8
	+ No.7
	+ No.6
	+ No.5
	+ No.4
	+ No.3
	+ No.2
	+ No.1
  
- Corrupt Government Officials and Corporate: controlled by the cult, mostly do white collar crime
- Corrupt Cops: follow orders from the Government Officials, they take advantage of small businesses in the city to extort money.
- The Cult Members: weak minded people who got lured and controlled by the leaders to do unspeakable crimes (similar to Aum Shinrikyo)

## Power System
- Forbidden Magic: unfortunately people with real/natural magic are extinct. So most magic in the game world comes from people making contract with interdimensional entities. You usually have to offer something to get something back but it's usually human souls.
- Curse Tattoo: some characters have these tattoos that modify their stats (ex: Ava has the Equalizer tattoo that matches her stat with the strongest person in her POV)
- Aura: characters can emit a circular aura around them. Different people have different rules inside their aura. If enemies step inside that aura range then they have to obey something. (ex: Nameless aura makes people unable to use magic)

## Weapon System (Work-in-progess)
- Normal weapon: guns, blades from the modern world
- Set weapon: the most powerful weapons in the game comes from one of the many sets. Each set is crafted made by one family.
	+ ... Set: has a demon in it, gives user new unique skills.
	+ ... Set: bless its owner with big stats and shield.
	+ ... :usually weak but apply crazy debuff that stacks.
	+ ...
	+ ...
- Cursed Weapon: hard to use but powerful, has some small stat debuff which force players to build their character to compensate, there is a gruesome, disturbing origin behind these weapons.

## Charm system (I need more ideas)
Charms only last for the duration of a run; they disappear when player dies in that stage.

## Combat System
- HP bar: health
- DODGE bar: character will automatically dodge when this bar isn't 0.
- STRESS bar: cult members can cast psychological attacks on player that cause debuff (slow, lower accuracy, lower damage) when it reach below 0.

## Gameplay (I need to learn how to code)
I want the game to be a Roguelike with RPG elements.
EX: if player lose on that stage, they only lose their "charms" (temporary boost items), they always keep their weapons, skills, levels,...

Probably violent combat like John Wick, DOOM or Kill Bill. I will think about it when I start coding lmao.
